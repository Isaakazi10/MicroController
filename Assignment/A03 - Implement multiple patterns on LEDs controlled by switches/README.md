Pattern:
Write a Embedded C program to display the multiple patterns on the LEDs controlled by the switches. For every switch, dedicate a LEDs glow pattern. The pattern should change on key press.

Output Requirements:

1 - Upon giving the power supply, all 8 LEDs should be OFF.

2 - Now, press switch-1 on the Digital Keypad, LEDs should glow according to the pattern-1*

3 - Press switch-2, LEDs should glow according to the pattern-2*

4 - Press switch-3, LEDs should glow according to the pattern-3*

5 - Press switch-4, LEDs should glow according to the pattern-4*


*pattern-1: The LEDs should glow from Left to Right and Right to left as explained in the assignment-1.
*pattern-2: The LEDs should glow from left to Right and switch off from left to right, no direction control/ direction change.
*pattern-3: The LEDs should blink alternately.
*pattern-4: The LEDs has to blink nibble wise, i.e first 4 LEDs will be ON, next 4 LEDs will be OFF, after first 4 LEDs will be OFF, next 4 LEDs will be ON.


Inputs:
